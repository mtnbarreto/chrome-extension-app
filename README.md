3. Open the project in VSCode (okay if you have preference for another IDE).
4. Run `npm install` to set up the dependencies.
5. Run `npm rum build` which build the extension for production. It provides the optimized app code at `dist` folder and also a zip compressed file to upload to Chrome Extensions store under `artifacts` folder.

### Dev server & enabling HMR

`npm run dev`
then ypu can make changes on the code and expect the chrome extension to update accordingly.

### Linter & Code Formatting

`npm run format` runs the formatter ensuring code . `rome format . --write` under the hood.

`npm run lint`. runs checks. `npx rome check .` under the hood.

`npm run lint:fix`. runs checks and apply safe fixes and formatting. `npx rome check . --apply` under the hood.

Project also set up [github action](/.github/workflows/checks.yml) that runs the `npx rome ci .` when push on `main` or  `release` branch.

# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
