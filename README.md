# ü§ñ Chrome Extension App - Modern Web brought to Chrome Extensions

Chrome Extension App uses the best web development practices and provides the best DX. It enables developers to quickly develop Chrome extensions app; nowadays, countless ML applications using LLM provide a browser extension app, which was my primary motivation for building this boilerplate project.

## üíª Using the template to create your own Chrome extension

Follow these steps to use this template:

1. Fork this repository. 
2. Clone the fork to your local machine. 
3. Open the project in VSCode (okay if you prefer another IDE).
4. Run `npm install` to set up the dependencies.
5. Run `npm rum build`, which builds the extension for production. It provides the optimized app code in the `dist` folder and a compressed zip file to upload to Chrome Extensions store under the `artifacts` folder. 

### Load the extension in Chrome

6. Open Chrome and then go to Chrome -> Settings -> Extensions. Make sure developer mode is enabled.
7. Click `Load unpacked` button and select `dist` folder from the project's root folder.

Check the extension load properly by clicking on the extension icon. You should see the extension popup:

Check content script works by navigating to Gmail. Something like this should be displayed:

### Dev server & enabling HMR

`npm run dev`
then you can change the source code and expect the Chrome extension to reload and update accordingly.

### Linter & Code Formatting

`npm run format` runs the formatter, ensuring consistent code style. `rome format . --write` under the hood.

`npm run lint`. runs checks. `npx rome check .` under the hood.

`npm run lint:fix`. runs checks and applies safe fixes and formatting. `npx rome check . --apply` under the hood.

Project also set up [github action](/.github/workflows/checks.yml) that runs the `npx rome ci .` when push to `main` or  `release` branch.
